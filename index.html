				I code because the Internet is my playground. I started my programming journey in October 2017 when I joined University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp. My favorite leisurely coding activity is changing a website's content in dev tools. It's fun to break things apart like a puzzle to see how they work, and also use my twisted sense of humor to change things. When not coding, I can usually be found hiking, writing, cooking, or in a bookstore. I also studied business at the University of Virginia, and I enjoy dissecting the business strategy of any industry from newspapers to videogame makers.

				 If you want to take your business to the next level while adding an element of fun, or just want someone to discuss the universe with, contact me.
